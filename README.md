# 2025W-Water-Challenge
Water is at the center of some of today’s most urgent global challenges.
From biodiversity loss in river systems and hidden pollutants in drinking water,
to water footprints, floods, and droughts driven by climate change,
these issues increasingly shape our environment and daily lives.
 
The student exhibition explores water challenges through tangible artifacts and interactive design projects. By transforming complex and often invisible water-related issues into physical, experiential works, students invite the public to see, touch, and reflect on the realities of water today.
 
Through creativity, critical thinking, and hands-on design, we encourage new perspectives on our relationship with water from now and in the years to come.
